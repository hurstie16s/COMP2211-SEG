Upon starting the application, you have access to the main scene.
On this screen, you can modify the runway parameters and add/remove objects.

If the result shows a valid runway, the resulting runway will be displayed at the bottom of the screen.
Should you wish to change the values for the runway, simply click on the value you wish to change and type in a new one.
If you enter a non-numeric value, the program will flag that issue and prevent you from continuing.
Should the values you enter not form a valid runway, an error will show up at the bottom listing all problems.

If you want to enlarge the runways you can expand the view, or you can click on either of the runways at the bottom.
This will open up a large view of just the runway in question, and you can press T to toggle top/side view.
On all scenes, you have access to a help menu which can be toggled with the H key.
If you only want the values, those are available on the top half of the main screen, and are automatically updated.
